# Railway Deployment Status

## ✅ VERIFIED WORKING CONFIGURATION

**Last Verified:** 2025-08-18 20:03:23

### Current Configuration Status
- ✅ `railway.json` - Proper Vite/React deployment config
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` - Forces pnpm usage for consistent builds
- ✅ `package.json` - Clean Vite scripts, no merge conflicts
- ✅ `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Single package manager lock file
- ✅ Repository cleanup complete - No Flask/legacy conflicts

### Removed Problem Files
- ❌ `railpack.json` (was causing Flask build errors)
- ❌ `yarn.lock` (was causing package manager conflicts)  
- ❌ Legacy Flask backend structure
- ❌ Merge conflicts in package.json

### Build Process
```bash
# Railway Build Commands
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build

# Railway Start Command  
pnpm preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```
