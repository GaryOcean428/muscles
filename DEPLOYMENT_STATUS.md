### Current Configuration Status
- ✅ `railway.json` - Optimized for Railway with better health checks and restart policies
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` - Enhanced to use Node 20, memory optimization, and build caching
- ✅ `package.json` - Added engine constraints and optimized scripts for Railway
- ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Optimized for Railway's memory constraints and improved chunking
- ✅ `.npmrc` - Added for consistent pnpm configuration
- ✅ `.nvmrc` - Added to enforce Node 20 usage
